Project: Recipes

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main page which will have links to a few recipes. 
Once I complete the project I will have shown my knowledge of writing and understanding html tags and how they work.
<p>I will use  tags for paragraphs, tags for headings and for lists. The links used will be absolute because I will link external sources found on the internet (http//...). The important parts of the text I will highlight  and emphasize the text. If I decide to add images I will use theimage tag with the alt attribute.
