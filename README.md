Project: Recipes

In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main page which will have links to a few recipes. 
Once I complete the project I will have shown my knowledge of writing and understanding html tags and how they work.
I will use <p> tags for paragraphs, <h1> tags for headings and 
<ul>/<ol> for lists. The links used will be absolute because I will link external sources found on the internet (http//...) using <a href="http//...">. The important parts of the text I will highlight with <strong> tag and emphasize the text with <em>. If I decide to add images I will use the <img> tag with the alt attribute.
